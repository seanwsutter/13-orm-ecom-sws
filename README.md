# 13 ORM E-commerce Database

## Description

Using a development database along with an `Express.js` API we will use [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) to interact with [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) database using `Insomnia`.

## Installation

* Clone repository on your local machine, install node packages, config your `.env` file, login to your MySQL.
* Once connected to MySQL, `source the schema.sql` and use database, then quit MySQL. 
* In the terminal enter `npm run seed` to seed and sync the database. 
* Enter `Nodemon server.js` in the terminal to start the server.

## Usage 

With the Insomnia app we will be able to interact with the database using the following API routes:

* GET All, GET One by id, POST (CREATE), PUT (UPDATE), DELETE
